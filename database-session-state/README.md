# Intent
This design pattern is used to maintain the user's session data across different requests. The user's session data is stored in a database as committed data, not in server or the client.
This pattern has the advantage of using stateless objects in the servers, however, the time to retrieve the data from the database is a disadvantage of this pattern.
